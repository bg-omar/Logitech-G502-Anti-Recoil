### Ad the following line into LGhub script:
`dofile("C:/Users/yourusername/AntiRecoil.lua")`

#### This will run the script but give you ability to edit outside of lghub

#### .capslock will enable the script

### Amount of recoil  
`left shift` + `mouse click`   =  +Y   
`left lctrl` + `mouse click`   =  -Y 

### time between shots  
`right shift` + `mouse click`  =  +T   
`right rctrl` + `mouse click`  =  -T   

### Logitech-Ghub-Functions.json
I've added a Logitech-Ghub-Functions.json with almost all functions for the Logitech G502 mouse,  
these are to teach us and IntelliJ IDEA the LG-hub specific lua functions
